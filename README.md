# Synthetic OHLC Price Generation

An interactive Python tool for generating synthetic financial time series data in **OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close)** format using **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** and visualizing it with `matplotlib`.

---

## Features

- ðŸ“ˆ **Generate synthetic closing prices** using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM).
- ðŸ•° **Simulate realistic intra-period price movements**:
  - High and Low prices are generated based on user-defined volatility and intra-day steps.
- ðŸŽš **Interactive controls** for adjusting key parameters:
  - **Drift (Î¼)**: Controls the average rate of return.
  - **Volatility (Ïƒ)**: Determines the variability of returns.
  - **Number of intra-day steps**: Adjusts the granularity of intra-period price movements.
- ðŸ”„ **Real-time updates**:
  - The chart dynamically regenerates when parameters are adjusted.
- âš– **Toggle between linear and logarithmic scales**:
  - Switch between linear and log scales for better visualization of exponential trends.

## Prerequisites

To run this tool, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib mplfinance

## How It Works

### Data Generation
- **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**: Simulates daily closing prices based on user-defined drift (Î¼) and volatility (Ïƒ).
- **Intra-Day Price Simulation**: Generates high-resolution intra-day price movements between open and close prices, ensuring consistency with the overall trend.

### Interactive Controls
- Use sliders to adjust drift (Î¼), volatility (Ïƒ), and the number of intra-day steps.
- Click "Generate New Data" to create a new synthetic dataset.
- Toggle the "Log Scale" button to switch between linear and logarithmic y-axis scales.

### Visualization
- Candlestick charts display the synthetic OHLC data, providing an intuitive representation of price movements.
- A 20-period moving average (MAV) is overlaid on the chart for additional context.

## Applications

This tool is useful for various applications in finance, education, and research:
- **Education**: Understand how financial models behave under different conditions, such as varying drift and volatility.
- **Algorithm Testing**: Test trading strategies or algorithms on synthetic data before deploying them in real-world scenarios.
- **Research**: Explore the impact of drift, volatility, and intra-day granularity on price movements.
